Step 1:
Mr. Quanta awoke in a strange room, his mind foggy and his memories hazy. He looked around, taking in the unfamiliar sights and sounds. He noticed the walls were painted a deep blue, and the floor was covered in a thick, plush carpet. He heard the faint sound of music playing in the background, and the smell of incense filled the air. He felt a sense of unease, as if he had been here before, but he couldn't remember how he got here.

Step 2:
He tried to recall the events of the day before, but his mind was blank. He remembered waking up in his own bed, but after that, everything was a blur. He thought he had gone to the escape room, but he couldn't be sure. He thought he had gone to the rooftop pool, but he couldn't remember. He thought he had gone to the miniature golf course, but he couldn't recall. He was beginning to feel frustrated and confused.

Step 3:
Suddenly, he remembered the events of the day before in vivid detail. He had gone to the escape room with his friends, and they had all had a great time. After that, they had gone to the rooftop pool, where they had enjoyed the sun and the cool water. Finally, they had gone to the miniature golf course, where they had laughed and joked as they played. He smiled as he remembered the fun he had had, and he was relieved to know how he had gotten here.
