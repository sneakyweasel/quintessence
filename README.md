## IonQ challenge

Landing page: <https://ionq.com/>

To recap, for this challenge, you must use a quantum computer to *generate* something new.
Some ideas:

- Make music with a quantum computer (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12408.pdf>)
- Render graphics with a quantum ray tracer (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12797.pdf>)
- Use procedural generation to make a new world (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11510>)
- Make a QGAN (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03924>)
Once you've debugged your code with regular simulation, please try our noisy simulators before graduating to hardware (if you have time). Hardware noise can have unexpected effects!
We will judge your entry based on both (1) how quantum it is and (2) how cool it is.

### Requirements

- Must be new and innovative
- Must be quantum
- Added points for social media visibility
