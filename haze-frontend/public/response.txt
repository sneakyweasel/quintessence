Mr. Quanta awoke on the rooftop bar, feeling a bit disoriented. He had no idea how he had gotten there, but he had a vague recollection of a comedy club. He remembered laughing and having a great time, but he couldn't remember any of the jokes or who he was with.

Mr. Quanta decided to go back to the comedy club to try and jog his memory. He arrived at the club and was immediately greeted by the bouncer. He asked the bouncer if he had seen him the night before, but the bouncer said he hadn't.

He remembered laughing and having a great time with a group of friends. He remembered the jokes and the drinks they had shared. He realized that he had had an amazing night and he was glad he had come back to the comedy club.
